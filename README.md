## A Java Game (mainly an engine at this point)

This is a game I've been working on and off (mainly off) outside of my work and school studies. It started as a console application and slowly became a 2D game engine and procedural map generator.

I'm currently trying to implement a component based entity system using the Ashley library from libGDX to help create procedural entities to populate the world.
